As an Aspiring Data Scientist, I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation. With over 2 years of hands-on experience as a data analyst, I have developed a strong foundation in Data Mining and Visualizations.

In my role, I was responsible for performing data cleaning, data mining and providing useful insights to the clients. I used tools such as Pandas, Power BI and Tableau. My work involved both data analysis and model creations for the datasets to get the insights.

**Key achievements include:**

Working on larger data sets, cleaning the data, training and testing the data.
Implementing models to get accuracy of about 98%.
Utilizing SQL for database management. My experience also includes working with AWS Azure for deployment, which has honed my skills in adaptive planning and iterative progress.

**Technical Skills:**

SQL: Adept at writing queries to validate data and ensure accurate functionality.

Python: Knowledgeable in programming languages used for analysis and creating machine learning models.

Outside of professional work, I actively engage in open-source projects and continuously seek to expand my knowledge in Cloud Computing and Web Development. I am also involved in various tech communities and enjoy collaborating with peers on innovative projects.

I am eager to apply my skills and experience in software engineering to new challenges and opportunities. Letâ€™s connect! Feel free to reach out to me at Linkedin. I look forward to exploring how I can contribute to your team and projects.
